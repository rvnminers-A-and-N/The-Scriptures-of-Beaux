# The Scriptures of Beaux
This is the story of Beaux 1 and Beaux 2, and their journey through the world of crypto, trying to navigate the scriptures, in a conquest to echelon and change their lives for the better.

## What It Means To Echelon
Echelon (verb)

To rise swiftly through the ranks of life, career, or social status, leaving your friends in the dust. This often leads to an awkward situation where you're living the high life, and your old pals are still lounging on the same old couch, expecting you to shower them with your newfound glory.

Example Sentence: "After getting that tech job, Leo's been echeloning like a king, while his beauxs are still playing video games in their mom's basement, waiting for him to splash some cash their way."

## Why Are We Echeloning?
To escape the matrix!
